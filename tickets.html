<h1>Tickets</h1>

<div class="light-bg">
    <p class="large-text">
    Whisky Web II is a residential conference, and ticket prices will reflect this.  Early bird tickets will
    start from around &pound;175 based on two people sharing, with an upper price-point for the premium option
    of having a double room to yourself.
    </p>
    <p class="large-text">
    When we have sold through all of the early bird tickets, the standard tickets will go sale.  The cost of a standard
    ticket will be dependent upon those rooms that we have left, and will of course be more expensive than the early bird
    tickets, so get in early to secure the best deal!
    </p>
    <p class="large-text">
    We hope to have finalised the ticket price-points by the end of the week, but in the mean time believe that
    the cheapest early bird ticket will be &pound;175, with the most expensive standard ticket being no more than &pound;350.
    Don't forget that your ticket buys you a two day residential conference with accommodation; travel to and from Edinburgh;
    and lunch and dinner included.  We're pulling out all the stops!
