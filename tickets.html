    We'll start selling tickets as soon as we can! But in the mean time you probably want to know how much
    this roller coaster of web fun is going to be, right?  We'll be selling an initial batch of <em>early-bird</em>
    tickets at &pound;150, and once they're gone, they're gone!  Once we've sold through the early-bird tickets
    the full-price tickets will go on sale at &pound;200.
    </p>
    <p class="large-text">
    Remember, the cost of the ticket includes one night of accommodation at the spectacular Airth Castle.  Unfortunately
    we can't offer concessions or transport for those who may want to return to Edinburgh or elsewhere after the first day.
    We are providing an all-inclusive residential conference experience, and we hope you'll agree that a night
    in a beautiful castle is well worth the cost!
